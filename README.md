Third person Open World action game developed in Unreal Engine 5.5 

An Open World Action Game built in Unreal Engine 5.5, featuring a vast landscape that spans dense forest, scorching deserts, and perilous dungeon, all packed with high-quality meshes and lush foliage.

The project is structured with dedicated classes for core elements such as Actors, Treasures, Pickups, Weapons, the Main Character, and Enemies, with a carefully designed Parent Class that allows both the Main Character and Enemies to inherit only the logic they truly need.

Every character has its own Animation Blueprint, complete with distinct states and montages, while combat is brought to life with unique attack sound effects and dynamic, damageable health bars for all enemies.

Gameplay depth is enhanced with Breakable Pots that spawn treasure, health pickups for the player, and collectible souls dropped by defeated enemies. The Main Character also features an auto-regenerative stamina system dedicated to dodging, encouraging fluid and tactical combat.

Enemies are powered by AI Perception, enabling them to patrol and intelligently navigate the world. With root motion attacks and motion warping, battles become intense, fast-paced, and highly challenging.

For traversal, Main Character can ride a stylish Hoverboard, allowing MC to move across the massive open world with both Speed and Style.
